java implementation of a logging daemon using commons-daemon 

partOne.sh -> downloads list of movies from IMDB
partTwo.sh -> start | stop| restarts logging daemon

(logging deamon reads from downloaded movie files and writes to log file. Log file is rolled over
as per time delay [sleep method] in FileLogger class)

partThree -> ruby script that archives all files
testFileCreator.sh used to generate random files for testing ruby (partThree.rb script)

see README-Linux-Sys-Admin-documentation.txt for instructions on running
